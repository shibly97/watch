			We are pleased to offer our customers the chance to recycle their old electrical items.
			There are 3 options for you to hand your old item to us for WEEE purposes:<br/><br/>
			1. Visit any 'Goldsmiths' store nationwide (UK)<br/><br/>
			2. Visit our Reading store at: Watch Shop Ltd, 27 - 29 Cross Street, Reading, Berkshire, RG1 1ST, United Kingdom<br/><br/>

			<div class="free2">Your internet protocol address is logged when placing an order. This is for reasons of fraud protection. All orders are scanned strictly for fraud by our fraud department before they are shipped. If you specify a different shipping address to the billing address then your order may take longer as we have to perform the necessary checks.

			<div class="free">Why recycle?</div>
			<div class="free2">Unwanted electrical equipment is the UK's fastest growing type of waste. Many electrical items can be repaired or recycled, saving natural resources and the environment. If you do not recycle, electrical equipment will end up in landfill where hazardous substances will leak out and cause soil and water contamination - harming wildlife and also human health.</div>

UK VAT is charged to all shipping locations in the EU, with the exception of France, Germany, Italy and Spain where local VAT is charged. For other destinations, such as the US, no VAT is due but the price you pay remains the same.

			2.2 The price of the Goods does not include delivery charges, which will be notified to you during the checkout process and before you confirm your order.

			<br/><br/>
			<span class="bold_text">PLEASE NOTE:</span> Due to the ongoing situation with Covid-19, during this time, our repair centres are not fully operational. We would therefore appreciate you refraining from sending watches back for repairs until the situation changes and our centres are back running as normal.
