	<div class="text_head"> Coffee</div>
	<p class="text">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor.
	Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.
	Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="text">The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines. It was in what is now Yemen that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking. But the coffee seeds had to be first exported from East Africa to Yemen,
	as Coffea arabica is thought to have been indigenous to the former. The Yemenis obtained their coffee via Somali traders from Berbera who in turn procured the beans from the Ethiopian Highlands and began to cultivate the seed.

		<div class="coffee_text">By the 16th century, coffee had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and northern Africa. The first coffee seeds were smuggled out of the Middle East by Sufi Baba Budan from Yemen to the Indian subcontinent in 1670.</div>

	<h1><center>Coffee Preparation</center></h1><br/>
	Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the
	particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials,
	the process includes four basic steps: raw coffee beans must be roasted, the roasted
	coffee beans must then be ground, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water
	for a certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.
	for a certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.
	Coffee is usually brewed immediately before drinking. In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already roasted, or already roasted and ground. 
	Coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.
